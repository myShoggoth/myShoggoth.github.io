        <br><small class="description">So, like... who are you?</small></h2>
      <p class="lead">Andrew Boardman's career began at seventeen when he wrote a text editor for BBS
      systems. At Carnegie Mellon University, he helped use genetic algorithms in
      groundbreaking research on programmatic stock trading.</p>

      <p>After graduating from Colorado State University, with a CS major and Economics
      minor, he worked on desktop publishing software at Quark in Denver, CO. He then
      co-founded the consulting company WindBourne and eventually became its President.</p>

      <p>After the dot-com bust he joined Microsoft, where he mostly worked on real-time
      communication products, and he was promoted to manager after one year.  He
      worked on cutting edge products, as well as Office, Windows, in the developer
      division, and in MSN. Andrew was the lead developer for Windows Live Messenger.</p>

      <p>He left Microsoft to co-found his second startup, TalentSpring, a recruiting
      company based on graph theory, where he learned many of the hard startup lessons.</p>

      <p>Andrew then consulted with Seattle area startups before co-founding LearnVC.com.
      LearnVC accelerated entrepreneurs learning startup financing, empowering them
      to negotiate with the same information as VCs. They quickly pivoted to a SaaS
      capitalization table product.</p>

      <p>Andrew's consulting practice includes competitive analysis, software
      and systems architecture, manager mentoring, product and project management,
      due diligence for financial deals, term sheet evaluation, and software
      development.</p>
