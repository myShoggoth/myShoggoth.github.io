My website has gone through many iterations through the years, the last using
TypePad. This is long out of date, and I wanted to update to something
modern looking and nice, but retain the ability to create content in a
reasonably abstracted way that separates content from presentation.

I decided on Hakyll in large part based on my desire to improve my Haskell
skills. I also found the idea of generating a static website appealing, one
of the first iterations of this website was a static site generating system
based on XSLT and XML files.

Pair Hakyll with Github Pages and I have a nice solution that is slick as
well as free. Shiny.
