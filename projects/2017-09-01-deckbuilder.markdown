The eventual goal of this project is to have a game engine that allows for
simulating new or existing deckbuilding games, either to test strategies or
stress test new game designs.

I used Haskell both for practice with the language as well as to test my theory
that it is a perfect language to do this kind of work.

So far I've implemented the basic Dominion set (first and second editions), as
well as the Intrigue expansion (first and second editions).
