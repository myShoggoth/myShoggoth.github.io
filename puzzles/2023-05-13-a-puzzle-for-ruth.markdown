title: A Puzzle for Ruth
rules: Normal sudoku rules apply.  Digits separated by a V have sum to 5, those separated by an X sum to 10. Digits separated by a black dot have a 1:2 ratio. Digits in killer cages sum to the number in their upper left, and may not repeat within the cage. Not all Vs, Xs, and dots are necessarily given.
