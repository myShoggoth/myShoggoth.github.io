title: Guide Arrow Puzzle Pack
rules: Shade some empty cells so that no two shaded cells are orthogonally adjacent and the remaining unshaded cells form one orthogonally connected area. No complete loop of cells may be unshaded (including 2x2s). An arrow indicates the only direction in which one could begin a path to the star without going through a shaded cell or backtracking.
