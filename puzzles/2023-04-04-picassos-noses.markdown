title: Picasso's Noses
rules: Normal sudoku rules apply. Consecutive digits along the green German whisper line must differ by at least five. Digits along thermometers must strictly increase, not necessarily in consecutive order. Knightmare global constraint - Digits adding to 5 or 15 may not be a knight's move apart. There is no global anti-knight constraint.
