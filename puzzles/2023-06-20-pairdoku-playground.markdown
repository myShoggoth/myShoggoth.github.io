title: Pairdoku Playground
rules: Normal sudoku rules apply. Pairdoku - there are two different grids with the same solution, but not enough information to solve alone. Two solvers work together by sharing information on what digits are constrained, but not what the constraints are nor describing their grid. The grids are blurred above so too much information is not given out ahead of the solve. Each grid has information about its own constraints. These grids are generally domino constraints and killer cages.
