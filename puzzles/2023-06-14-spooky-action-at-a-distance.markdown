title: Spooky Action at a Distance
rules: Normal sudoku rules apply. Cells in the same position relative to their 3x3 region must not contain the same digit. Digits on a thermometer must strictly increase as they move away from the bulb. Adjacent digits along green lines must differ by at least 5. Clues outside the grid indicate the sum of the first X digits in that row or column, where X is the first digit seen.
