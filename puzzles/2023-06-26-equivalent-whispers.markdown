title: Equivalent Whispers
rules: Normal sudoku rules apply. Equal sum lines (blue) - sums within each box the line passes through are the same. German Whispers lines (green) - adjacent digits along the lines must differ by at least 5. Little killers - the number outside the grid is the sum of the digits of the indicated diagonal.
