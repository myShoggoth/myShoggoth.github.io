> Neil DeGrasse Tyson, possibly the world’s favorite astrophysicist, has been making the rounds on television this month to talk about his new book on why NASA matters, after the agency’s decades-old space program closed down last year. Tyson says that if NASA is given the money it needs, the agency will stimulate the economy and inspire better, more innovative projects from students.
