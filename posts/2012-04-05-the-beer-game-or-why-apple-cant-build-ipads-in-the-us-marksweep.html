  <h2>The Beer Game -or- Why Apple Can't Build iPads in the US</h2>

<p>When President Obama asked Steve Jobs what it would take to make iPhones in the United States, the late Apple co-founder supposedly quipped: “Those jobs aren’t coming back.”</p>

<p>A great article that talks about the importance of logistics in running a business, particularly one that is producing actual physical objects.</p>
<p>I’ve often thought that if I had grown up in a time that didn’t have computers I would have gotten into logistics. My favorite video game series of all time is The Settlers from BlueByte (at least through #4 in the series), which at its best was all about supply chain management and logistics. I often pine for another game that does it as well.</p>
<p>When people think about outsourcing stuff like software development they need to be aware of these dynamics. What’s the turnaround time to get a change made? What’s the feedback loop look like? I think one of the reasons for the success of Pair Programming is the immediacy of the feedback loop on the technical side, it is like having an ongoing code review with near 0 latency.</p>
<p>The Lean Startup movement, Minimum Viable Product, and similar concepts try to reduce the latency on product/market feedback for the same reason.</p>
<p>So the key question: What areas in your business do you need minimum latency, and are you structuring things to make that happen?</p>
