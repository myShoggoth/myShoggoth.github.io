<p>A U.S. judge yesterday threw aside a much-anticipated trial between Apple and Google-owned Motorola Mobility over smartphone patents. The decision and a blog comment by the same judge could prove to be a watershed moment for a U.S. patent system that has spiraled out of control.</p>

<p>All I really have to say about this is…. YAAAAAAAAAY.</p>
<p>I hope it signals massive changes to come, but I don’t want to get my hopes up too much since there is a lot of (very cash-rich) vested interest in maintaining the status quo.</p>
