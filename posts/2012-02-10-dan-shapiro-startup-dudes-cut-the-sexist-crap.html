<blockquote>
<p>Last week I was speaking on what would have otherwise been a terrific panel. It was Frank Artale from Ignition, Tom Duterme from Groupon M&amp;A, Andy Sack from Lighter Capital &amp; Founder’s Co-op, and me talking about funding &amp; exiting. The only thing that spoiled it was yet another guy in the tech scene putting forth yet another objectifying/patronizing treatment of someone with two X chromosomes.</p>

<p>Guys - we’re adults now, start acting like it. No, this isn’t everyone acting this way, but those who don’t need to call the few who do on it.</p>
