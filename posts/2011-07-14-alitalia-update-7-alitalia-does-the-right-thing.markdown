title: "Alitalia Update #7: Alitalia does the right thing!"

I really didn't expect this, particularly from Alitalia at this point, but as a response to my fed up email to Delta which I copied Alitalia on, they have stepped up to do the right thing, albeit a couple months late.

> Dear Mr. Boardman:
> Allow me to clarify that it is the sole responsibility of the passenger to travel with proper documentation. However I realize that you feel strongly about this issue and we do not want this unpleasant experience to be your last impression of our service. Therefore I will make an exception to authorize a full refund of your ticket. Note that a $20.00 handling fee applies and will be debited to your credit card.

Awesome. It does make me feel better about the idea of doing business with them, and getting a full refund on both tickets was a huge relief. I did wait a few days before writing this post just to see the refund in my credit card activity list Just In Case. It has come through, so now I feel good about saying Alitalia Did The Right Thing.

I'm still pretty wary about Delta, however, and having them as an alliance partner will make it challenging for me to schedule a trip when I'm avoid flying Delta, but we'll see how that works out.
