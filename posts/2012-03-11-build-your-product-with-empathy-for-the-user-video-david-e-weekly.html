<p>Great talk, particularly valuable for those who are early on and thinking about their product design.</p>
<p>I had lunch with David a few weeks ago, and it was one of the most valuable hours in my career. I’m still in the midst of rethinking and reworking the product based on his ideas and feedback, and incredibly excited to be able to show it once I’m done!</p>
