title: New VCHub.com release for July 7th, 2011
---

Just released a new version of [http://vchub.com/](http://vchub.com/ ) with major improvements to option grant handling. Info at [http://lrn.vc/9](http://lrn.vc/9).

If you have a startup or work with them and are in the Bay Area I'll help you put info in and teach you hands on in exchange for feedback! If you're outside of the Bay Area or RTP we'd still like to work with you, just maybe not as in person.
