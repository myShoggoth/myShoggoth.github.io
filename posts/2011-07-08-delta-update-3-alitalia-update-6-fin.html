  <h2>Delta Update #3 (Alitalia Update #6): Fin?</h2>
  <p>I’m not sure if it is coincidence or if my email prompted their reply (I suspect the latter) but I got a response.</p>
<p>Executive summary: Not our fault.</p>
<p>I’ll quote my reply first and then their email after.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RE: Case Number 3552612</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>While I agree that the policies of the State Department are beyond your control, there are many things that are completely within your control that make this episode a terrible customer experience, and there are actions within your control that would make it better.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is unacceptable that the way that you told me about this requirement was when I showed up at the ticket counter to get my boarding pass. There are other airlines that prompt international buyers for their passport expiration dates when they are buying the tickets specifically to avoid this issue. As I mentioned in my summary of the situation, if I had known about the requirement I would have easily renewed my passport because we did so at that time for my partner.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How do I know that other airlines prompt their customers this way? Because when I tell people about this story, which I do often, the only way that people know about this passport expiration requirement is when someone they know has been bitten by it. One couple had bought tickets on Air Canada (if I remember right) and had been prompted for the expiration date, they didn’t know the reason why until they heard my story.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If the State Department changes their requirements and you know I can’t fly don’t let me get to the damn airport before letting me know. If you don’t know if I can fly don’t sell me the tickets, but if you do, let me know when you know about the change. You took a bad situation and made it more traumatic and upsetting for no good reason. There was no reason for me to pack or go to the airport.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m copying Alitalia on this because a lot of this is their fault, they are the ones who sold me the tickets and didn’t give me sufficient information. However, as partner airlines if you have these requirements you need to pass them on to your partners because the customer experience is the whole thing, not just what you do on your label.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which gets us to fixing the situation. No one really tried to help me, the customer, fix this. The Alitalia rep wanted to charge me more than twice what I had already spent on the tickets just to have an equivalent trip next year (above what I’ve already spent). And this was after two or three hours on the phone trying to figure out what the options were. This was not helping, this was kicking me while I was down. It was terrible and infuriating and made an upsetting situation even worse.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All my “customer service” experience with both of your airlines is you defending your actions and explaining why none of this is your fault.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t care. I don’t know why you think I do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You are not powerless pawns in this story, you are the ones who know and in many cases make the rules, you are the ones who took thousands of dollars from me in exchange for a trip to Italy so I could spend even more money once I got there.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then, due to your inability to think of what your customer needs rather than what you want, I was denied the ability to take that vacation and simultaneously told that you’d keep that money, too, since all of this was all my fault and if I knew all the rules I would have known that. Passive aggressive at best.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And when I say “you”, please keep in mind I’m taking about the airline as a whole, I don’t blame individual customer reps for this. They’re doing their jobs, but their ability to fix problems is severely limited by the airlines’ rules on what they can do. Alitalia and Delta clearly think of the customer service departments as necessary cost centers, not the core of their businesses like Zappos. I think it is telling that while I was at the ticket counter dealing with this at the airport the next guy in line was also furious with Delta and having a horrible experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The best solution, the one that would have made me instantly feel better about having given my business to Alitalia (and by extension, Delta) would have been either a refund or a full credit. Yes, it is not your fault, yes my passport should have been more current, but if you had just refunded or made it easy for me to use that credit towards a future trip on your airline(s) all would have been good and I would feel fine spending money with you in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This, by the way, is how my experiences with Southwest have always been, and why I fly with them whenever possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead, not only do I not want to risk doing business with either airline in the future, I want to warn everyone I know not to do so, either. This is my second bad experience in a row with Delta, where something that should have been no big deal in a business sense is instead a big deal because of stupid policies that are customer hostile.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So, despite what you claim below, my business is obviously not important to you, not at all. Can you imagine doing business in the future with a company that treated you like this? The marginal cost of taking actions that would help this situation (refund or dollar-for-dollar credit) would be tiny, but the policy is to clearly not do anything that you don’t absolutely have to, no matter what.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That means I am guaranteed that if I do business with you in the future I’m going to have another bad experience, because that’s the way you’ve designed it. Delta has horrible customer service because that’s the corporate culture, I have no doubt that the VP of Customer Care is primarily rewarded based on how well she keeps costs down.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind that this started on May 14th (actually it started when I bought the tickets, but we went over that above), I sent my first email about it on May 17th, and we are now at July 8th before you say “not our fault, nothing that can be done”.</p>

<p>Here is the email that was a response to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>July 8, 2011</p>

<blockquote>
<p>RE: Case Number 3552612</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mr. Boardman</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our office is in receipt of your correspondence from our Sky Team partner, Alitalia, regarding your and your travel companions’ travel from San Francisco. On behalf of everyone at Delta Air Lines, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience that you encountered when you were not allowed to board your flight as planned.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Boardman, I am truly sorry for the delay in our response and for the discrepancies you encountered with your international documentation. Unfortunately, due to constant changes made by the U. S. State Department, passport and visa requirements can vary from day to day. However, feedback like yours is important to us and will help in the future to improve our overall customer experience. Please know I will be sharing your comments with our Airport Customer Service leadership team in San Francisco for internal follow up.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Further, I understand your concern with having been advised that you were unable to travel due to the expiration date on your passenger. I apologize that our agent advised you that the passport must be valid six months beyond the period of stay. Due to the expiration date was at or less than 90 days, the kiosk gave you the message that you were referring to. Please know that, per the U.S. State Department website, when traveling to Italy, the passport must be valid for at least three months beyond the period of stay. You may view this information on their website. http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1146.html#entry_requirements</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For future reference, our web site provides some International Travel Information. However, passengers are responsible for complying with the laws and obtaining the necessary documents required for entry into another country (including Canada and Mexico) prior to their day of travel. Travelers should check with the U.S. State Department at www.travel.state.gov for information regarding the international documentation necessary for their travel.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If a passenger travels without proper documents, the passenger may be denied entry into that country and the airline may be fined. Our Contract of Carriage governs the terms and conditions of every ticket and states the following (Rule 45).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Each passenger desiring transportation across any international boundary will be responsible for obtaining all necessary travel documents and for complying with all government travel requirements. The passenger must present all exit, entry and other documents required by the laws, and, unless applicable laws provide otherwise, shall indemnify the carrier for any loss, damage, or expense suffered or incurred by such carrier by reason of such passenger’s failure to do so. Carrier is not liable to the passenger for loss or expense due to the passenger’s failure to comply with this provision. Carrier reserves the right to refuse carriage to any passenger who has not complied with applicable laws, regulations, orders, demands, or requirements or whose documents are not complete. No carrier shall be liable for any aid or information given by any agent or employee of such carrier to any passenger in connection with obtaining such documents or complying with such laws, whether given orally or in writing or otherwise.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Subject to applicable laws and regulations, the passenger agrees to pay the applicable fare whenever carrier, on government order, is required to return a passenger to his point of origin or elsewhere due to the passenger’s inadmissibility into or deportation from a country, whether of transit or of destination. The fare applicable will be the fare that would have been applicable had the original ticket designated the revised destination on the new ticket. Any difference between the fare so applicable and the fare paid by the passenger will be collected from or refunded to the passenger as the case may be. Carrier may apply to the payment of such fares any funds paid by the passenger to carrier for unused carriage, or any funds of the passenger in the possession of carrier. The fare collected for carriage to the point of refusal or deportation will not be refunded by the carrier, unless the law of such country requires that such fare be refunded.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope this explanation provides a clearer understanding of our policies. Again, I apologize for the problems you encountered. Your business is important to us and given the opportunity of serving you in the future, I am confident Delta will not only meet but exceed your expectations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
