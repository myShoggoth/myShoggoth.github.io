  <h2>Alitalia Update #7: Alitalia does the right thing!</h2>
  <p>I really didn’t expect this, particularly from Alitalia at this point, but as a response to my fed up email to Delta which I copied Alitalia on, they have stepped up to do the right thing, albeit a couple months late.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mr. Boardman: Allow me to clarify that it is the sole responsibility of the passenger to travel with proper documentation. However I realize that you feel strongly about this issue and we do not want this unpleasant experience to be your last impression of our service. Therefore I will make an exception to authorize a full refund of your ticket. Note that a $20.00 handling fee applies and will be debited to your credit card. Thank you. Elizabeth Santella Manager</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Awesome. It does make me feel better about the idea of doing business with them, and getting a full refund on both tickets was a huge relief. I did wait a few days before writing this post just to see the refund in my credit card activity list Just In Case. It has come through, so now I feel good about saying Alitalia Did The Right Thing.</p>
<p>I’m still pretty wary about Delta, however, and having them as an alliance partner will make it challenging for me to schedule a trip when I’m avoid flying Delta, but we’ll see how that works out.</p>
