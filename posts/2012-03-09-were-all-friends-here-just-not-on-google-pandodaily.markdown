title: We’re All Friends Here, Just Not on Google+

> Even after identifying himself as a Google+ fanboy and having literally written the book on the social network, Guy Kawasaki had no choice but to ask the tough questions in his SXSW keynote interview with Google’s Vic Gundotra.

I don't dislike G+ from a technology point of view, or a user experience point of view, but it is true that the circle of friends that I have that use it are mostly Google peeps.

What I do dislike is the stupid crap Google has done to its other properties (particularly Reader) to try to force me to use it. I nearly "shared" this in Reader (which would have put it in my G+ stream), but having remembered this went to some trouble to make it happen in TypePad instead.
