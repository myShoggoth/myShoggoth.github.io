<blockquote>
<p>The Internet is often described as a festering pit of electronic hate, but in the same way your gut is a festering pit of bacteria – the vast majority are harmless, and you’re actually better off for having them around. Ninety percent of people might be assholes, but we’re all assholes about different things. So when one group declares themselves the voice of the majority, they get stomped like a goomba in Mario’s biker bar.</p>

<p>I usually find cracked.com articles funny, but this goes far far beyond that. This takes satire to a new level, mocking hate groups to a nearly unfair degree.</p>
<p>Well done, Cracked, well done.</p>
