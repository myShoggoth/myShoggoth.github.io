<p>I don’t dislike G+ from a technology point of view, or a user experience point of view, but it is true that the circle of friends that I have that use it are mostly Google peeps.</p>
<p>What I do dislike is the stupid crap Google has done to its other properties (particularly Reader) to try to force me to use it. I nearly “shared” this in Reader (which would have put it in my G+ stream), but having remembered this went to some trouble to make it happen in TypePad instead.</p>
