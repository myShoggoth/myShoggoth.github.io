<blockquote>
<p>In 1957, Gordon Moore and the “Traitorous Eight” formed Fairchild Semiconductor and created the basis of what would become Silicon Valley. But despite the undisputed importance of the microchip, Fairchild’s biggest contribution might have more to do with how the company was started than what it produced.</p>

<p>This is a great article that talks about the real reason Silicon Valley is different, and the fundamental thing people have to get right if they want to replicate the success or model.</p>
<p>A big part of that is capital’s embracing of failure, and understanding that when they take bets on entrepreneurs the lessons learned from failures can be more important that from successes.</p>
