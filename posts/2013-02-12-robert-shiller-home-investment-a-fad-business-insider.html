<p>“Absolutely!” Shiller exclaimed. “Housing traditionally is not viewed as a great investment. It takes maintenance, it depreciates, it goes out of style. All of those are problems. And there’s technical progress in housing. So, new ones are better.”</p>

<p>This is a great article, something I think about every time I consider buying a house again. In the past I’ve been lucky (even selling my last one at a bad time for personal reasons), but if you think about it, it isn’t a good investment. That’s not a good reason to buy a home.</p>
<p>So maybe in the future I’ll rent and only buy if things are perfect? Maybe. It isn’t so easy to avoid the idea that rent is wasted money.</p>
