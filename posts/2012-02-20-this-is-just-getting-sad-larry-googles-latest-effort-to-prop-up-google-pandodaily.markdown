> Google continues to scorch everything it once considered sacred in the name of propping up the most successful social media site that no one I know actually uses. (Yes, other than you, Scoble.)

This is more or less what I've been seeing: Google is sacrificing all the things that made me love them and buy into all their products. Now they're spending all of that goodwill quickly trying to get me deep into G+.

It reminds me a lot of my time at Microsoft, when that company was sacrificing good products (and potential products) in the hopes that a "Better Together" strategy would lock everyone in the world into the Windows/Office world.

I think it will have similar effects: As viable alternatives are available, people will bail, and the company will start sliding towards irrelevancy.
