title: "Dan Shapiro » Startup dudes: Cut the sexist crap"

> Last week I was speaking on what would have otherwise been a terrific panel.  It was Frank Artale from Ignition, Tom Duterme from Groupon M&A, Andy Sack from Lighter Capital & Founder’s Co-op, and me talking about funding & exiting.  The only thing that spoiled it was yet another guy in the tech scene putting forth yet another objectifying/patronizing treatment of someone with two X chromosomes.

Courtesy of @bindr, a good writeup on the kind of crap that happens far too often in the startup community.

Guys - we're adults now, start acting like it. No, this isn't everyone acting this way, but those who don't need to call the few who do on it.
