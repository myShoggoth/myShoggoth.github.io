<p>Background for this mess is <a href="http://www.myshoggoth.com/2011/05/dhs-and-alitalia-ruined-my-saturday.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Alitalia is being made to look positively customer friendly compared to Delta so far, who have not responded at all in over three weeks.</p>
<p>I just sent:</p>

<p>RE: Case Number 3601924</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It has been almost two weeks since I sent this mail, which was nearly two weeks after I got a response. Are there any updates, do you need further information?</p>

<p>I don’t hold a lot of hope that anything will come of this, but I think at this point I’ve given Alitalia and Delta the opportunity to make me happy and they’ve declined the offer. I’m going to get ahold of customer advocates again with the update and see what they suggest.</p>
<p>One name I’ve heard a few times is <a href="http://www.elliott.org/">Christopher Elliot</a>, who I emailed at the beginning of this and he responded with <a href="http://onyoursi.de/wiki/travel/airline/alitalia-airlines/">this link</a> pointing me at the Alitalia customer service contact info which I already had (but this would have been incredibly useful if I hadn’t). I didn’t follow up because I wanted to try to actually working with them to resolve it first.</p>
<p>I tried, it didn’t work, we’ll see what he suggests.</p>
