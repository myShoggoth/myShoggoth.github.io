<blockquote>
<p>When my daughter was 18 months old, my husband and I decided to take her on a little summer holiday. We picked a coastal town that’s a few hours by train from Paris, where we were living (I’m American, he’s British), and booked a hotel room with a crib. Bean, as we call her, was our only child at this point, so forgive us for thinking: How hard could it be?</p>

<p>This book sounds very interesting, both the article and video are worth checking out. It agrees with most of what we know/do, with the possible exception of letting the newborn cry at a few weeks old. That doesn’t make any sense to me, seems better to wait until they are post-grub stage (3+ months) before trying to teaching patience.</p>
